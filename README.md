# File_System_Implementation
This project aims to implement a versatile file system that supports Three different file allocation structures, including contiguous, linked, indexed. These structures govern how files are stored and managed on disk. The project includes the development of file operations such as creation, reading, updating, and deletion, tailored to each allocation structure.

The primary objectives are to understand the limitations of traditional contiguous allocation, explore alternative file structures, and measure their impact on aspects like space utilization and file access times. By evaluating the performance and scalability of these structures, this project provides valuable insights into optimizing file management in computer systems.
